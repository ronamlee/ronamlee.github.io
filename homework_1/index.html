    <h1>CIS 128 - Home Work 1 </h1>
        <p><img src="images/rona.jpg" width="130" height="180" alt="rona cartoon portrait" class="wrap"/> My name is Rona and I grew up in San Francisco and now live in the bay area. I worked in several High Tech Corporations for many years and now I'm attending College of San Mateo. <br> At CSM, I am studying Digital Media courses focused on Web Design. I found myself having lots of fun learning a new profession. <br>When I am not attending school and studying, I spend time growing orchids, succulents, and various flowers and fruit trees in my backyard and that's how I relax from my busy schedule. I also enjoy biking by the bay, hiking, joining group exercise classes and walking on the beach whenever I can. </p>
        
        <p>The major reason I am attending this class, CIS 128  is to to gain more knowledger and techniques on developing mobile web apps for smart phones and tablet/pad devices. </p>

        <h2>Technologies for this class </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss" target="_blank">W3C </a> - This is my favorite website ever since I started taking DGME courses. It is the Authority on Website Design and a reliable source to locate the latest web page configuration tips and tricks and also helps to troubleshoot incorrect or non-optimized issues on existing webpages. When I have trouble with HTML, CSS or JS, this is the site Iâ€™ll visit to find help and solutions.</li>

                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> - This is another very helpful website that has an excellent set of resources that can be used for development of any type of site, including the CSS, HTML and JavaScript resources. I use this site frequently when I run into problems or issues. I find MDN is more detailed, up to day and also includes information that which browsers works or doesn't work; has much more browser compatibility info (including for mobile).
